Some people seen to have a knack for learning languages.They can pick up 
new vocabularids,master rules of grammar,and learn to write in new language 
more quickly than others.They do not be any more intelligent than others,so 
what makes language learning so much easier for them? Perhaps if we take a 
close look at these successful language liarners we may discover a few of 
the techniques which make language learning easier for them.
First of all,successful language learners are independent learners .They 
do not depend on the teacher;theydiscover their own way to learn the lang 
uage .Instead of waiting for the teacher to explain,they try to find the 
patterns and the rules for themselves.They are good guessers who look for 
clues and form their own conclusions.When they guess wrong,they guess again.
They try to learn from their mistakes.
Successful language learning is active learning.Therefore,successful 
learners do not wait for a chance to use the language but they ask these 
people to correct them when they make a mistake.They woll try anything to 
communicate.They are not afraid to repeat what they hear or to say strange 
things;they are willing to make mistakes and try them to learn to thins in 
the language than to know the meaningof every word.
Finally,successful languages are learners with a purpose.They want to learn 
the language because they are interested in the language and the people 
who speak it .It is necessary for them to learn the language in order to 
communicate with these people and to learn from them .They find is easy to 
practice using the langugae because they want to learn with it.
What kind of language learner are you? If you are a succesdful language 
learner,you have probably been learning independently,actively,and purposefully.
On the other hand ,is your language learning has been less than successful,
you might do well to try some of the techniques outlined above.
